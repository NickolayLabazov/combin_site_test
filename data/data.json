As a brand ambassador, it's my duty to interact with as many of our supporters as possible. Combin allows me to search for specific hashtags associated with the topics of the event and comment on or like them. It also allows me to pinpoint specific locations that we want to target. I recommend Combin and will definitely continue using it myself."

Combin doesn't just blindly follow, like and comment on everything that vaguely seems fit, but provides convenient tools for searching, analyzing and engaging target audience en masse. Whether you’re a blogger or a well established company, this app can help you realize your true potential."

Instead of having to spend 3-4 hours a day engaging, I can simply use the app, put in a hashtag and engage automatically with people without having to lift a single finger. It really is an easy to use app and an easy on the eye interface. Results have been almost immediate with people responding back and following. Highly suggest this app to any user."

I like the architecture, it’s easy to understand based on existing mental models how things work and very usable, good work! The design is minimalistic, so you can focus on your tasks. I prefer it to other services packed full of features and analytics that 'normal' people don't understand as they face so many other issues to get their business run. I want it clean, easy learning, usable and effective, like Combin."

Unlike many other applications, it gives you a real control over the automated actions — it’s you who chooses who to follow and what to like. There are many target audience search settings that help finding and reaching real, potentially interested accounts. You save time and limited Instagram actions while getting more genuine engagement with your content. Overall, Combin is more affordable and effective than other tools I’ve tried."
